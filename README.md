# ERS Microservices

The **Employee Reimbursement System (ERS)**, decomposed into real services — the endpoint of the
Phase 4 refactor that began as a legacy Java 8 / JDBC / Hibernate / standalone-Tomcat monolith,
became a single Spring Boot service, and now runs as **three independently deployable apps behind
a gateway**:

**Databases-per-service:** no cross-database joins exist. `ers_reimbursement` carries a
replicated reference copy of users/roles **without the password column** — the credential is
structurally absent from that service's world. With a static seed the copy is simply seeded
identically; in production it would be kept in sync by events from auth-service (so a profile
rename propagates eventually, not instantly — that is the consistency trade this layout buys
its autonomy with).

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Spring Boot 3.3.6 (3.3.6 minimum: Gateway 4.1.6 needs Framework 6.1.15) |
| Gateway | Spring Cloud Gateway (release train 2023.0.5) |
| Language / build | Java 17, compiled on JDK 21; Maven multi-module |
| Persistence | Spring Data JPA + Hibernate; **one PostgreSQL database per service** |
| Messaging | Apache Kafka (spring-kafka); JSON events, each side owns its event record; idempotent consumer (correlation-id ledger) + retries + dead-letter topic |
| Legacy intake | Spring-WS contract-first SOAP (XSD → xjc classes; WSDL served at runtime) |
| Containers | Dockerfile (multi-stage, one recipe for all services) + docker-compose (7 containers) |
| Security | Self-issued **RS256 JWT**: auth-service signs with a private key + serves JWKS; others verify with the public key (no shared secret, so verifiers cannot mint) |
| Passwords | BCrypt (hashes carried over from the monolith seed) |
| Tests | JUnit 5 + MockMvc per service; write tests are `@Transactional` (roll back, seed stays pristine) |

## The service boundary, in one paragraph

`ers-auth-service` **owns identity**: it holds the only `JwtEncoder`, the only BCrypt verification,
and the only write access to `users`/`roles`. `ers-reimbursement-service` is a **pure resource
server**: it validates tokens it genuinely cannot mint (it holds only auth-service's PUBLIC key,
fetched from the JWKS endpoint — RS256's asymmetry, the fix for the old shared-secret HS256) and maps
`users` **read-only, without the password column** — the credential physically cannot leak from a
service that never loads it. The gateway routes by path and passes the Bearer token through
untouched: authorization stays with the service that owns the resource, so a compromised gateway
cannot mint identities. Each service owns its own database outright — the reference-data copy in
`ers_reimbursement` is the price of that autonomy, paid in eventual consistency.

## Prerequisites

- **A JDK 17+ with a compiler** (built on Temurin JDK 21 — a JRE has no `javac`).
  > **On this dev box:** the default `java` on `PATH` is a JRE-only 21 (no `javac`), so the build
  > silently falls back to JDK 8 and fails with `release version 17 not supported`. A full Temurin
  > JDK 21 is installed at `~/jdks/jdk-21.0.11+10` — point every `mvn`/`java` command at it with
  > `JAVA_HOME=~/jdks/jdk-21.0.11+10`. To install one on a fresh machine, see the monolith
  > `STARTUP.md` install appendix (same JDK, different version line — grab 21 instead of 8).
- **PostgreSQL** with the ERS schema seeded (below).

## Run with Docker (the whole system, one command)

```bash
docker compose up --build
# host port 8080 taken (e.g. the monolith's Tomcat)? ->  GATEWAY_PORT=9080 docker compose up --build
```

Five containers: two seeded postgres databases + the three services; only the gateway is
published to the host. The database containers run each service's init script on first start.

## Database setup (running the services without Docker)

Both services run `ddl-auto=validate` — they never create or mutate schemas. Each service seeds
its **own** database:

```bash
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE ROLE ers LOGIN PASSWORD 'ers';"   # once, if not present
createdb -O ers ers_auth
createdb -O ers ers_reimbursement
psql -d ers_auth          -f db/auth/init.sql
psql -d ers_reimbursement -f db/reimbursement/init.sql
```

(`db/ers_script.sql` is the legacy shared dump, kept for history and monolith parity — the
services no longer use it.)

## Build, test, run

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=~/jdks/jdk-21.0.11+10        # on this box; any full JDK 17+ works elsewhere
# Datasources default to localhost/ers_auth and localhost/ers_reimbursement (user/pass ers);
# override with AUTH_DB_URL/USER/PASSWORD and REIMB_DB_URL/USER/PASSWORD if yours differ.
# JWT is RS256: auth-service GENERATES its signing keypair at startup (no secret to set) and
# serves the public half at /.well-known/jwks.json. reimbursement-service fetches that to verify;
# it defaults to http://localhost:8081/.well-known/jwks.json, override with ERS_JWKS_URI if needed.

mvn test          # all modules, 46 tests green (Kafka tests run against an embedded in-JVM broker;
                  # a real broker is only needed at runtime - localhost:9092 or KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP)
mvn package -DskipTests

# three terminals (or background each):
java -jar auth-service/target/ers-auth-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar                    # :8081
java -jar reimbursement-service/target/ers-reimbursement-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  # :8082
java -jar gateway/target/ers-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar                              # :8080
```

> If the monolith's standalone Tomcat is running locally it already owns 8080 — start the gateway
> with `--server.port=9080` (routes are unaffected; they target 8081/8082 directly).

Smoke test through the front door:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"username":"<user>","password":"<pass>"}' | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
curl -s localhost:8080/requests -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # gateway -> reimbursement-service
curl -s localhost:8080/roles    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # gateway -> auth-service
```

## The asynchronous intake (SOAP → Kafka → domain)

Legacy partners submit reimbursement requests as SOAP — the protocol B2B integrations actually
still speak. The adapter is an **anti-corruption layer**: it keeps XML at the edge, translates a
valid submission into a JSON event on `reimbursement.request.submitted`, and acknowledges with a
correlation id. reimbursement-service consumes the topic and runs the **same `RequestService.submit`
fan-out the REST endpoint uses** — one domain rule, two transports. "Accepted" therefore means
*queued*, not persisted: the pipeline is at-least-once and eventually consistent, and the consumer
handles both consequences of that promise:

- **Duplicates (idempotent consumer):** a crash between the database commit and the offset commit
  replays the event, so the listener records every correlation id in a `processed_event` table
  **in the same transaction as the domain write** and skips ids it has already seen — a replay
  cannot create a second request. A deterministic business rejection (unknown location/requester)
  is also marked processed: replaying it can never succeed, so its outcome is final (the async
  twin of REST answering 4xx).
- **Failures (dead-letter topic):** processing exceptions are retried (3 attempts, 1s backoff —
  a database blip heals itself), then the record is published unchanged to
  `reimbursement.request.submitted.DLT` and consumption moves on, so one poison event cannot
  block the partition. Malformed payloads that never deserialize are classified as fatal and
  dead-letter on the first attempt (`ErrorHandlingDeserializer`). The DLT is the operator's
  inbox: everything there needs a human, nothing was silently lost — and records keep the wire
  contract's field formats, so a repaired event can be replayed onto the main topic as-is.

**Trust note:** a REST caller proves the requester's identity with a JWT; a SOAP partner *asserts*
`requesterUserId` in the payload. Production would authenticate the partner itself (mTLS or
WS-Security) and allowlist which user ids it may submit for — documented on the endpoint, out of
scope here.

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/ws -H 'Content-Type: text/xml' -d '<soapenv:Envelope
  xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
  xmlns:req="http://revature.com/ers/soap/requests">
  <soapenv:Body>
    <req:submitReimbursementRequest>
      <req:requesterUserId>3</req:requesterUserId>
      <req:amount>88.25</req:amount>
      <req:eventDate>2026-07-01</req:eventDate>
      <req:eventLocationId>1</req:eventLocationId>
      <req:requestedEvent>Partner Conference</req:requestedEvent>
    </req:submitReimbursementRequest>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>'
```

## Auth model

1. `POST /login` (auth-service, via the gateway) verifies the BCrypt hash and returns a signed JWT
   (`sub`=userId, `role` claim, `iss`/`iat`/`exp`).
2. Every other request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. **Each service validates the
   signature itself** — the gateway does not authenticate; it forwards.
3. Roles enforced per service: path rules in each service's `SecurityConfig`, plus `@PreAuthorize`
   on `GET /roles`. Unauthenticated → **401**; authenticated but wrong role → **403**.

### Endpoints (all through the gateway on :8080)

| Method & path | Service | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /login` | auth | public | mint a JWT |
| `PUT /users/me` | auth | authenticated | update own username/email/password; requires `currentPassword`; 403 wrong password, 409 taken value |
| `GET /roles` | auth | **Supervisor** | reference data |
| `GET /requests` | reimbursement | **Supervisor** | all employees' requests |
| `GET /requests/{id}` | reimbursement | authenticated | one request |
| `GET /requests/requester/{userId}` | reimbursement | authenticated | a user's requests |
| `POST /requests` | reimbursement | authenticated | submit for yourself (requester = token subject); fans out the approval chain; 201 |
| `PUT /requests/{id}/approval` | reimbursement | **Supervisor** | apply your approve/deny; returns `{"outcome": ...}`; 404 no vote, 409 waiting |
| `GET /approvals/pending` | reimbursement | **Supervisor** | your still-pending votes (the approval inbox) |
| `POST /ws` (SOAP) | soap-adapter | partner (no JWT — see trust note) | `submitReimbursementRequest` → acknowledged with a correlation id, processed asynchronously via Kafka |
| `GET /ws/requests.wsdl` | soap-adapter | open | the machine-readable SOAP contract |

## Configuration

| Property | Env var | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| auth datasource | `AUTH_DB_URL` / `AUTH_DB_USER` / `AUTH_DB_PASSWORD` | `localhost:5432/ers_auth`, `ers`/`ers` | auth only |
| reimbursement datasource | `REIMB_DB_URL` / `REIMB_DB_USER` / `REIMB_DB_PASSWORD` | `localhost:5432/ers_reimbursement`, `ers`/`ers` | reimbursement only |
| `ers.jwt.jwks-uri` | `ERS_JWKS_URI` | `localhost:8081/.well-known/jwks.json` | reimbursement (verifies via auth's public key) |
| `ers.jwt.ttl-seconds` | `ERS_JWT_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | auth only (issuer concern; RS256 keypair is generated at startup, no secret) |
| Kafka broker | `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP` | `localhost:9092` | soap-adapter (produce) + reimbursement (consume) |
| route targets | `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, `REIMB_SERVICE_URL`, `SOAP_SERVICE_URL` | `localhost:8081/8082/8083` | gateway |
| gateway host port | `GATEWAY_PORT` (compose only) | `8080` | docker-compose |
